## General description of the application

Our application aims to facilitae the character creation for the video game Baldur's Gate 3 by allowing players to prepare their characters ahead. This preparation allows for a better understanding of the use of spell and more strategic planning.

At the start of the adventure, players must create a character by selecting their race, subrace, class, subclass and origin. Each choice influences the character's skills and characteristics, which evolve over 12 levels.

Diving into the game without preparation can be risky, because the choices made affect directly the gameplay experience. Additionally, as players progress, they unlock new skills and sorts, frequently confronting them with difficult choices.

The goal of this app is to anticipate each level, each abilities or spell depending on the race and the class that are being chosen. This allows players to plan their progress throughout the adventure, maximizing efficiency and gameplay satisfaction.

### Navigation
In our application, we have opted for the integration of a visible menu in order to make it easier for users to use. This approach saves the user from having to figure out how to access the different features of the application.

The menu is made up of three elements that are clearly identifiable using icons:

> - A “profile” logo, to access your personal space (or Profile Page)
> - The game logo or a home logo, to return to the home page
> - A star-shaped icon, to access the list of characters created by the user, plus "foreign" characters (i.e. created by other people but modified by the user)

In addition to the menu, the app offers other navigation options, including buttons like “See more” or “Create.” Additionally, a profile picture at the top right also provides quick access to the user profile.

These different navigation options have been put in place to provide a friendly and intuitive experience to the user, allowing them to easily navigate in the application and quickly access the features they are looking for.

## Home

Our homepage has been designed in a simple and intuitive way, with three distinct sections to provide an enriching experience for users.

#### Character creation
In this first section, users have the opportunity to start their adventure by creating their own character. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, our user-friendly interface will allow you to bring your dream character to life.

#### Community Characters
The second section is specially dedicated to community characters. Share your creations with other users and discover unique characters created by the community. You will be inspired by the diversity and creativity of the characters shared here.

#### Media and social networks (Who is not on this system design)
Finally, our third section is a gateway to media and social networks. Stay up to date with the latest news and announcements regarding the game. Explore additional content, discover tips and guides, and stay connected with other players through our social networks.

## Home

On the homepage, we have several elements such as:
- Character Creation: You can create your own character using our user-friendly interface. Customize your character's traits, skills, and appearance to perfectly match your vision!

- Community Character Display: Discover characters created by other users of our application. Explore a variety of unique characters and get inspired for your own creations!

We have designed an intuitive user interface with a slider on the homepage. The third slide is partially hidden to encourage users to explore further. We have used contrasting colors such as black, opaque gray, and purple to highlight clickable elements and buttons.

#### Character List

This interface features the same "Cards" system showcasing community characters. These individuals are characterized by their "Name," "Race," and "Class." There is also a button that allows viewing specific character details.


### Screen 5 / Page 5
![Frame 109 (1)](https://github.com/mmicastres/sae401-thomas-zabalo-etienne-gonella/assets/150163380/8baf02a9-ec48-449a-8a92-7fe11e1bf7e9)

## Character Creation

Race Selection: The user starts by choosing the race of their character from the eleven available options. Each race has detailed descriptions and unique characteristics, including:

> - Attack Range: This characteristic indicates the preferred attack range of the race, whether it's melee, ranged, or both.
> - Skills: Each race has special skills that provide unique advantages in different situations.

Once the user's choice is made, they can proceed to the next step of character creation.

## Justification for the Choice 
Implementing "Cards" for character selection has numerous advantages. Visually appealing, the "Cards" provide a clear and concise presentation of all available character options, making it easier for users to compare and decide. Their interactivity also allows users to explore each option in detail, aiding in further development. By combining visibility and ease of use, "Cards" offer a better user experience for character selection.

## Character Creation

#### Sub-Race Selection
Some races offer different sub-races, each with its own specific characteristics and skills. These sub-races provide additional customization options to refine your character according to your gameplay preferences.

#### Description and Characteristics of Sub-Races
Each sub-race comes with a detailed description of its origins and distinctive characteristics. This allows the user to discover the unique traits of each sub-race, including their attack range, subclass skills, and other distinguishing features.

## Justification for the Choice 
We have implemented the same "Cards" system for organizing our sub-races.


### Screen 7 / Page 7
![Frame 128](https://github.com/mmicastres/sae401-thomas-zabalo-etienne-gonella/assets/150163380/e91e5f5a-8059-4fba-a6a4-10cae40574af)

## Character Creation

When the user chooses a sub-race, they will also have the opportunity to select a minor or major spell based on the sub-race they choose. Each of these spells offers unique benefits to enhance the character's skills.

Minor Spell Selection
Some sub-races offer a selection of minor spells from which the user can choose. These minor spells offer various effects, ranging from offensive skills to support or defensive abilities.

#### Characteristics of Minor Spells
Minor spells are accompanied by detailed descriptions of their characteristics, including their attack range, range, power, and other specific aspects. It may also be possible for the user to choose multiple spells depending once again on their race and class.

## Justification for the Choice 
We have implemented the same "Cards" system for organizing our spells.


### Screen 8 / Page 8
![Frame 152](https://github.com/mmicastres/sae401-thomas-zabalo-etienne-gonella/assets/150163380/9d490d15-852d-4b85-b694-5244011da4af)

## Character Creation

After the user has chosen their race and sub-race, it's time to define the path the character will take by selecting their class from twelve unique options.

#### Class Selection
There are twelve different classes to choose from. Each class offers a different playstyle, unique characteristics, and special skills.

#### Description and Characteristics of Classes
Each class comes with a detailed description of its origins, special skills, and main abilities that provide advantages in certain situations.

## Justification for the Choice 
We have implemented the same "Cards" system for organizing our classes.


### Screen 9 / Page 9
![Frame 177](https://github.com/mmicastres/sae401-thomas-zabalo-etienne-gonella/assets/150163380/71985467-ca0d-4c70-907d-2c45660b62c4)

## Character Creation

During character creation, the user will choose their origin, which will greatly influence the game. The character's origin is somewhat of a personal history.

#### Skill Enhancements


Each origin grants the character specific skills that correspond to their story and background. These skills can be used to solve puzzles, influence dialogues, or succeed in specific actions throughout your adventure.

#### Bonuses on Certain Actions
In addition to specific skills, each origin also offers bonuses on main abilities, providing an advantage in certain situations.

## Justification for the Choice 
We have implemented the same "Cards" system for organizing our origins.


### Screen 10 / Page 10

## Character Creation

#### Skills/Spells Selection
The user will have the option to choose from a selection of skills and spells. These choices will determine the character's abilities and talents, allowing them to adapt to different situations and playstyles.

#### Passive Abilities Throughout 12 Levels
Throughout progression, the character will benefit from special passives that grant additional advantages. These passives can enhance combat abilities, damage resistance, or offer unique special skills.

## Justification for the Choice 
We chose to use a dropdown list with several visible elements to offer a more intuitive user experience. This approach allows users to immediately see some of the available options without needing to fully expand the list.

By displaying multiple items from the dropdown list, we facilitate navigation and selection of options for users. This allows them to quickly browse through available choices and select the one that best suits their needs without having to scroll through a long list.

This approach is particularly useful when the list contains a limited number of options and users can easily visualize all possibilities without being overwhelmed by a too long dropdown list.

Finally, we offer the user the opportunity to name the character they are creating.

## Community Character List

### Use of Cards to Represent Community Characters
Cards are an effective way to visually present information about each community character. By using cards, we provide a consistent and organized presentation of the different characters, making it easier for users to compare and select. Each card concisely and clearly displays the character's name, race, and class, providing essential information to help users decide which character they want to view.


## Justification
### Button and Card Background Color Choices
We chose to use detailed purple buttons and a black background for the cards to create a striking and appealing visual contrast. Purple is a color often associated with royalty, creativity, and originality, reinforcing the idea of unique and extraordinary characters within our community. Additionally, the black background offers a strong contrast that highlights the elements of the card, thus drawing the user's attention to important information.

## Difference Between Web and Mobile 

### Consistent Design Across All Devices
We have chosen to maintain a consistent design across all devices, whether on desktop or mobile, to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. This visual consistency allows users to easily navigate from one device to another without losing their bearings.

### Desktop-Specific Features
While the design remains the same, the desktop version of our application offers an additional feature: the admin panel. We decided to integrate this feature only on the desktop version as we believe it will be more accessible and convenient for application administrators.

### Benefits of Visual Consistency
Maintaining the same design on both platforms allows users to easily navigate, regardless of the device they are using. This ensures a consistent and comfortable user experience, while offering specific features where they are most useful.


## Final Mockups
We have decided to choose Etienne's "Material Design" Design System because we found that this DS was more accessible and easier to use, especially since unlike Apple's, it offers more components and more frames to create the mockup. Therefore, we will have a more stable and suitable structure for web and mobile development.
